But after 21st Feb you will have to purchase the subscription again.\n",
    "But once the course is over and you have paid us Rs 5600(or 7 installments of Rs 799) you will be able to watch the paid sessions till Aug 2024.\n",
    "Why lifetime validity is not provided?\n",
    "Because of the low course fee.\n",

    "I am joining late. How can I pay payment of the earlier months?\n",

    "I have read that Placement assistance is a part of this program. What comes under Placement assistance?\n",
